- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Support for multiple machine learning algorithms

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anshulsm12/Stock-Market_Price-Prediction.git
   cd Stock-Market_Price-Prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
